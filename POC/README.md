This is an example of using Ansible to manage network infrastructure
- Use jinja templates to manage device configuration files
- Use roles to identify device functions in the network
- Use group variables files to apply values to multiple devices
- Use host variables files to apply unique values to device configurations
- Playbook for creating configuration templates for devices - site_build_pb.yaml
- Playbook for deploying configuration files to devices - site_deploy_pb.yaml
- Playbook for gathering device info - discovery_script.yaml
- Playbook for issuing show commands - show_command.yaml
